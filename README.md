## Tools

The following tools were developed for our paper

1. SATCOM Emulation Testbed: Testbed enabling reproducible transport as well as application layer measurements over SATCOM networks leveraging OpenSAND (https://github.com/kosekmi/quic-opensand-emulation)
2. SATCOM Evaluation: Visualization of ```SATCOM Emulation Testbed``` emulations (https://github.com/kosekmi/quic-opensand-evaluation)
3. qperf: A performance measurement tool for QUIC which also enables the proxying of QUIC connections  (https://github.com/kosekmi/qperf)
